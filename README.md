#Timely To Dos

By Emily Smith

The app is a way for me to learn React and try out some features. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# TO DO

1. Make prettier, new font, better color gradients - DONE 
2. better heading 
3. If no due date is selected use today, and insert stale logic
4. Check out mobile version and fix up 
5. Make sure ALL tag always comes first in category list
6. better colors for category tags

# Future features

1. swipe on mobile to delete
2. edit existing todo ?
3. add sass? css modules?
