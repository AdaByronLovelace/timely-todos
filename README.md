#Timely To Dos

By Emily Smith

The app is a way for me to learn React and try out some features. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# TO DO

1. Make prettier, new font, better colors - DONE 
2. better heading - DONE for now
3. If no due date is selected use today, and insert stale logic
4. Check out mobile version and fix up 
5. Make sure ALL tag always comes first in category list - DONE
6. better colors for category tags - DONE
7. filter by done - DONE
8. Clear form after submit - DONE


# Future features

1. swipe on mobile to delete or finish
2. edit existing todo ? - NOPE
3. add sass? css modules? also organize css
4. background colors of todos are gradients?
